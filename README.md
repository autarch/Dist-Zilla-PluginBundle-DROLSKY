# DESCRIPTION

This is the [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist%3A%3AZilla) plugin bundle I use for my distributions. Don't use
this directly for your own distributions, but you may find it useful as a
source of ideas for building your own bundle.

This bundle uses [Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist%3A%3AZilla%3A%3ARole%3A%3APluginBundle%3A%3APluginRemover) and
[Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist%3A%3AZilla%3A%3ARole%3A%3APluginBundle%3A%3AConfig%3A%3ASlicer) so I can remove or
configure any plugin as needed.

This is more or less equivalent to the following `dist.ini`:

    ; Picks one of these - defaults to DROLSKY::MakeMaker
    [DROLSKY::MakeMaker]
    [ModuleBuild]

    [Git::GatherDir]
    ; Both are configured by setting exclude_files for the bundle. Simple
    ; values like "./foo/bar.pl" are treated as filenames, others like
    ; "*\.jnk$" are treated as a regex.

# DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that **I am not suggesting that you must do this** in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at [https://www.urth.org/fs-donation.html](https://www.urth.org/fs-donation.html).
